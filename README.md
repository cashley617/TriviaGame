# TriviaGame

In this project, we use JavaScript and jQuery to initialize a basic Financial Literacy trivia game. 

Users have 30 seconds to answer 5 questions. If you run out of time, your results are graded and unanswered questions are tallied. If you finish before the timer, you can submit your work early. 

The most important piece of this game is the free, financial literacy information included.
